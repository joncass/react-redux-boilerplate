# React Redux boilerplate
## Introduction
This is my react-redux boilerplate. I wrote my own because I found that the existing ones either came with too many dependencies and an overly complicated example app, or there just wasn't enough substance to them. This one strikes the right balance for me, and if it works for you then feel free to use it!

What's in the box?
- React
- Redux
- Webpack
- ES Lint
- Babel
- Jest
- Minimal To-Do app

Note: the example app is intentionally bereft of styling. I recommend grabbing a React UI toolkit when you're ready to add styling and interaction.

## Usage
To get started:
```
  git clone https://github.com/joncass/react-redux-boilerplate
  npm run start
```
then visit `localhost:8000` in your browser.

Other useful scripts:
- `build` - Production build.
- `lint`  - Run the linter.
- `jest`  - Jest unit tests.
- `test`  - Lint and Jest.
